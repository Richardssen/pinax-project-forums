Pinax
------

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.


pinax-project-forums
---------------------

`pinax-project-forums` is an out-of-the-box Pinax starter project implementing forums.

This is an open-source forums project in progress, built on
[pinax-forums](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-forums)
and a number of other apps in the Pinax ecosystem.

Our goals with this project are to both provide scaffolding for the further
development of a variety of reusable apps for Pinax as well as a project that
can be used out-of-the-box or with minor customization as a clean,
feature-rich forums platform.
